## FAQ

**What's the difference between free and paid popup builders?**

Free plans typically limit active popup campaigns, pageviews, or advanced features like A/B testing and detailed analytics. They work fine for small sites testing the concept. Paid plans remove those limits and add sophisticated targeting, deeper integrations, priority support, and white-label options for agencies. If you're seeing decent results with free tools, upgrading usually multiplies those results through better targeting and testing capabilities.

**How do I make popups that don't annoy visitors?**

Timing and relevance are everything. Display popups based on behavior like scroll depth or exit intent rather than immediately on page load. Show first-time visitors welcome offers, but don't keep showing the same popup to people who already subscribed. Use the silence interval features built into tools like Claspo to space out displays. Keep the close button obvious and respect when someone dismisses your popup.

**Which popup builder works best for small e-commerce stores?**

Claspo offers the most generous free plan with full functionality, making it ideal for stores testing popup strategies without upfront investment. As you scale, Privy provides e-commerce-specific features like cart abandonment and email marketing in one platform. OptiMonk excels at product recommendations and gamification. The right choice depends on whether you prioritize cost, specific features, or ease of use.
